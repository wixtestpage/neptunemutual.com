        To manage risks, the Wix Finance platform provides users with a
        guaranteed stablecoin liquidity. On the other hand, the liquidity
        providers collectively earn the coverage fees generated in the pools.
        Additionally, the platform also incentivizes the users by “airdropping”
        a certain amount of WIX tokens to the early users on both sides.
